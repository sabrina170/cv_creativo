# Menu navigation from Wordpress menu

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pof/pen/GowrWg](https://codepen.io/pof/pen/GowrWg).

This is a menu built only with css3 and from the menu list generated by Wordpress. The trick was to play with before and after pseudo classes as Wordpress did not allow to wrap <ul> and <li> with other elements.
